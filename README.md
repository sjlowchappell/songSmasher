### Your favorite songs...just a little off

Song Smasher is a fun project that messes with your favorite lyrics. Enter the the name and artist of a song and we'll print out your song lyrics. Then, choose your smash level. A small smash will make every 12th word silly, a medium smash will make every 8th word silly, and a big smash will make every other word silly! Then we re-print the lyrics with the silly word in place. Give it a try!

This project was built using the Musixmatch and Merriam Webster dictionary APIs.

This was a fun and challenging project! I started this project after working on my first React app as I wanted to work on my pure JS skills without any libraries or frameworks. After going through Wes Bos' JavaScript 30 course, I wanted to improve my ES6 skills and bring them into a project. I played around more with Array methods, arrow functions, the spread operator, and more, while also using 2 different APIs (up from 1 from my previous API project). I enjoyed manipulating the DOM without the use of JQuery or React and I want to build more projects like this in the future to keep honing my vanilla JavaScript skills.
